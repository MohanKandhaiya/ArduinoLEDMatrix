# Sending the Text from Android App and Retrieving the text from Firebase Realtime Database and Displaying in 8X8 LED Matrix in Scrolling format

## Overview
In this project we are going to learn how to Send and Retrieve data from Firebase from Android App using NodeMCU.
So, the tutorial contains three part, first, we are going to interface 8X8 LED matrix with NodeMCU, second, we are going to create an Android Application to send data to firebase and finally, we are going to interface android app with NodeMCU through WiFi.

## Components Required 
Software 
•	Android Studio
•	Arduino IDE
Hardware
•	NodeMCU
•	Breadboard
•	LED Matrix
•	Jumper Wires

## NOTE
•	The program uses a library called LedControl. This library must be added to the Arduino IDE and the header file LedControl.h must be included in the program.
•	The use of this library file is to enable multiple MAX 7219 ICs to be integrated and also provide scrolling text. The library can be downloaded from this link.
